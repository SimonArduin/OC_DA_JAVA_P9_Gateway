# OC_DA_JAVA_P9_Gateway

Gateway microservice for [medilabo](https://github.com/SimonArduin/OC_DA_JAVA_P9_Medilabo)

This application receives http requests and reroutes them to the appropriate microservice, if the requests are authorized.

It is built with Spring as a Gradle project, using the following modules :
- Spring Security
- Spring Cloud Gateway

Incoming requests are received on port 8010 (specified in [application.yml](gateway/src/main/resources/application.yml)), then authorized according to URL, role, and request typeÂ :
